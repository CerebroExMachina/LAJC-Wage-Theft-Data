There are nearly 4000 rows in the data, each one with another business. We want to categorize these businesses intion industry groups to see if there are differences across groups.

Please help us by going to this form: (https://tinyurl.com/yyyfer65)

1. For each business, Google the business and find the business's website. 
2. Paste the URL in the column named SOURCE (URL)
3. Decide on which of the industrial groups best describes the business. In the column named INDUSTRY, there's a drop-down menu. Choose the best option.
4. If none of the categories seem to match the business, or if there's no way to know what the business does from the information we have, select OTHER and provide detail in the column named INDUSTRY (IF OTHER)
5. Write any additional notes you want to save in the column marked NOTES
