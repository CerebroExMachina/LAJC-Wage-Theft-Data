## Introduction and Objective
From Wikipedia (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wage_theft): "Wage theft is the denial of wages or employee benefits rightfully owed to an employee. It can be conducted by employers in various ways, among them failing to pay overtime; violating minimum-wage laws; the misclassification of employees as independent contractors, illegal deductions in pay; forcing employees to work 'off the clock', not paying annual leave or holiday entitlements, or simply not paying an employee at all.

"According to some studies, wage theft is common in the United States, particularly from low wage legal or undocumented immigrant workers. The Economic Policy Institute reported in 2014 that survey evidence suggests wage theft costs US workers billions of dollars a year. Some rights violated by wage theft have been guaranteed to workers in the United States in the 1938 Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA)."

In Virginia, people who believe they have been the victim of wage theft can file an official complaint with the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry (DOLI). The DOLI is responsible for investigating these complaints and for taking steps to return lost wages if the employer is found to have committed wage theft.

The [Legal Aid Justice Center](justice4all.org) is writing a report on the performance of the DOLI in investigating these official complaints. They filed a Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) request to acquire the raw dataset we will be working with. **Our objective is to produce clean datasets, tables, figures, and advanced analyses** to assist the LAJC in writing this report.

## Data
The raw data is available in the Raw Data folder on this repository. A codebook is listed here: https://github.com/code-for-charlottesville/LAJC-Wage-Theft-Data/tree/master/Raw%20data

## Goals
Here's a list of our immediate goals to help the LAJC. However, as you work on the data, you might have ideas for additional goals, and **you should feel free to pursue your ideas.**
