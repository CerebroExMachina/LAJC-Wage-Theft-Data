We are planning to meet several times to work on this project. If you haven't completed your work, use this folder to store your work in progress. Feel free to save scripts, image files, and data files here.   

If you would like someone at the next civic hackathon to pick up where you left off, please write a description with your commit to explain what you are doing and where you left off. It would also be helpful to write comments in your working scripts to provide more detail.

**Important:** please use unique file names, to avoid overwriting someone else's file. Don't use "datacleaning.R", use your name or something else that is descriptive and unique, "datacleaning_kropko.R" or "datacleaning_to_make_heat_map_9_17_2019.R" are better.
