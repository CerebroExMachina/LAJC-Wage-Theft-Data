Our goal is to provide **tables, images, and clean datasets** to the LAJC to assist them in writing their report on wage theft complaints to the Virginia Department of Labor and Industry. Please place your FINISHED PRODUCTS in this folder, to make it easy for LAJC staff to see your work.

Write a description when you commit to provide context and necessary notes and details about your work.
